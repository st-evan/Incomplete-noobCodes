Welcome. Hang on to yo hats cuz it's gonna be wild
'Moving on' python project developed by snt.evn to show current improvement status with the python language
Contained in here are concepts learned in the space of a month and used to develop a program
Some codes may seem redundant but forgive that. Also not 'every' conceppt is contained within, I fit in as many as I could
Happy assessment.
